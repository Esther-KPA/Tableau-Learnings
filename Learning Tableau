*** Some first beginner steps with Tableau;

*** Following  some steps below;
1. Download the dataset from kaggle/ any
2. Rename it to have it stored on your computer
3. If its in csv then upload it from the text file section
4. Click on sheet 1 to go to a space where you can create charts and dashboards
5. You can always drag dimensions / measures : Dimensions = Data immediately below "tables" , Measures = Data below dimensions section
6. Drag data accordingly, that going to columns and that going to rows. eg Year best if its a column and sum a row
7. Add a distinctive data set eg genre in the dataset that is different game genres, to "marks" section, on side of genre > click on colour
to give different line graphs colour
8. Add another dataset like sum-global cells to give the line graphs labels.
9. You can filter out datasets accordingly eg dataset - platform that has different gaming systems. Add it to the "filters" section
>> click on show all filters to choose which graphs to show
10. You can create a second worksheet to show distinct dataset not shown in first sheet >> Go to add worksheet at the bottom
11. Add dashboard and choose two charts you want to show

*** Calculated fields and bins ;
BINS : Ranges of numerical value, cant use data in form of text, only number eg year, etc
*** Steps ;

1. Go to numerical data you want to have in ranges
2. Right click >> Create >> Bins >> choose size 3 = numerical data in ranges of 3, 5 = range of 5, etc
3. You can hide or remove nulls though not recommended for work

CALCULATED FIELDS : Creating or using calculations to compare data in chart

1. You can use already existing calcuations - go to dataset. drop down menu >> Quick calculations >> choose calculation >> Drag it to 
measures section / press control and drag it to measures section

2. To create your own calculated field >> Go to data set, right click >> create calculated field option >> Insert desried calculation
>> click ok 

3. Rename the calculations as desired 
4. Also remove unwanted data sets to add data sets with new calculations.

CREATING VISUALIZATIONS
 - STEPS;
 1. To have two data sets charts, add data sets to "row" section.
 
 Dataset with location:
 1. Drag longitude that is generated to columns and generated latitudes to rows
 2. You can play around with the marks section to have colour, the design of visualization in map eg automatic, density, etc
 
 *** In visualization you can always add some  order at the end by "showing" the data starting with highest to lowest or lowest
 to highest.
 
 *** When adding data in "marks" a new one is constantle added to add a mark like "label" or colour", etc
