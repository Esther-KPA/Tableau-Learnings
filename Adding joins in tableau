*** Steps:

1. Drag required dataset >> drop down menu >> open >> join with desired dataset

*** 
- Inner join = matching info
- Left join = data in the left table but not matching right
- right join = data in the right table but not matching left
- full outer join = data in both tables despite if matching or not

*** Often employee / data ID is used to join but if you have other data "names" that are used to distinguish each row
then it is used eg "name of employee"

You can always add different data sets and join them accordingly.
