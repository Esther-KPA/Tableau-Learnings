*** Prior to start
Project Use-case : Where is the best place to buy a home and put it up on Airbnb? what factors to look for?
Thnings the person cares for: Number of rooms, location, price he can set
Help him find a really good place to pl;ace his airbnb business/investment

- Have a look at your data, what would you use and what's junk
- Double check ID's to see which ID matches the name, etc

Steps:

- Load the data onto tableau
- Dragged listing sheet to create a join >> Open
- Dragged calendar sheet to join it "iNNER Join" >> Used appropriate ID i.e Listing ID and Id
- Dragged reviews sheet to turn into a join "Inner join" >> used appropriate ID i.e listing reviews ID and ID

*!! Tableau can automatically make joins, be sure to double check if they are the correct ID's.
    Sometimes you can join multiple ID's

- Couldn't load more than millions of data in tableau public so >> removed reviews join
**1.  Starting with Price per zipcode :
Exclude nulls
Zipcode - columns, price (avg) - rows :changed from sum to average. >> Arraqnge from high to low >> add colour >> rename
**2. Creating map - respective of zipcode:
-dRAG ZIPCODE TO COLUMNS >> choose appropriate map >> add zipcode to "marks" edit the colour
**!! At first nothing showed up, I scrolled to the bottom and changed the unknown location to USA
** Add labels accordingly >> add price to "marks" >> makr it AVG to match bar graph
**! The area with high avg = Nice are that charges well and could be a good opportunity
** Remove nulls
**3. Want to know the best times to put it on the market for people to use (Person wants to buy but also live in it)
When are people spending the most money in Airbnb?
** Drag date from calendar data to columns and calendar - price to rows
** Split the year in quarter/month/week : We used weeks in example
**! there's a sharp drop in the end bc the data stops in nov 2016 >> You can remove it by using the "filter" in the drop down menu of week
*== The best time to put it on the market is summer / vacation and end of year holidays
**4. Factors affecting the price e.g The larger the house/ more number of rooms = the higher the price but we have to test hypothesis
** Convert bedroom "measure" into "dimension" OR you can drag it as is from measures section to columns >> drop down menu >> convert to value
** First visualization = number of bedrooms that has highest worth of listings i.e = brings in the most revenue is "One bedroom"
** Using avg price in rows and bedrooms in column = proves the higher the number of bedrooms the higher the return on investment
**5. What's his competition like? depending on bedrooms (No.)
** Distinctively shows the count (no.) of listings in the area >> Showing that "1 bedroom" LISTINGs are the most common
thus to have less competition >> invest in 4,5,6 bedroom apartments
*! Is there alot of demand for these? >> You could look at reviews, etc
**6. Add dashboard >> drag charts in space and >> place them as desired.
